## R Markdown
R markdown for whale Plot deconstruction. The plot came from a published paper in Population Ecology journal. https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1438-390X.1014

Plot caption: Whale sighting data comparison between Norm's Seat and Frenchman's lookout in 2010 over 120 hours of observation.

Issues with the original plot:
1. colour scheme is poor
2. used a bar plot for continous (time) data 
3. other presentation issues (grid lines)

The plan is to recreate the plot with geom smooth lines, correct the colour scheme. 

We used a Plot digitiser online tool to extract data from the image. 

We then imported the extracted data as a .csv file to rebuild the plot.
